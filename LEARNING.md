Learning Reflection:
During this project, I ran into a few problems that taught me more about both Next.js and Convex. At first, VS Code kept underlining my @/components and @convex/_generated imports in red. It turned out I needed to configure the same path aliases in both next.config.js (Webpack’s resolve.alias) and in tsconfig.json (paths). Once I aligned those, the TypeScript errors disappeared and my imports resolved correctly.

Another problem I ran into was getting Tailwind to play nicely with PostCSS. I saw warnings telling me to install @tailwindcss/postcss, so I added that package and updated my postcss.config.js. After that change, the directives @tailwind base, @tailwind components, and @tailwind utilities worked as expected and my styles applied without warnings.

Handling image upload with Convex storage took some experimentation. My final approach was to call api.recipes.generateUploadUrl() on the client to get both a signed URL and a storage ID. I then did a fetch( ..., { method: "PUT", body: file }) to upload the file, and passed the returned id into my create-mutation. On the server side, my list query checks for an imageRef and uses ctx.storage.getUrl(id) so I can display the image in each recipe card. That flow—from signed URL to Convex upload to signed read URL—really cemented how Convex file storage works.

I also got comfortable with Convex’s React hooks. After reading the docs and seeing a few real world implementations about how it automatically re-runs when I push a mutation, I learned how to work with useQuery. Similar approach for useMutation.

Time spent:
Overall, I spent about 10 hours building this app. The first few hours were about reading Convex docs/actual implementations and understanding concepts. Then I spent an hour or so working through most CRUD handlers. And then I spent another 2 or 3 hours on the front end components and stylings. Followed by a testing session for about an hour to make sure all features works. Took me quite a while to get the image uploading and display working. Writing docs and deploying it on Vercel took me another hour at the end.
